# Lyapunov_attractors
Short code that generates beautiful images from pseudo-random number generation and chaotic series.
Original inspiration from Paul Bourke http://paulbourke.net/fractals/lyapunov/ .\n
I also integrated a way to reproduce results even though they were generated at random, and so be able to change the color or the size of the image (for a big print for example).
